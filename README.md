> **Note**: Currently, FirstCommitter uses the public Github API for unauthenticated users, with a limit of **60 requests per hour** per **IP address**. In the future, I plan to implement OAuth authentication allowing users to log in with their GitHub account and potentially increase their rate limit to 5,000 requests per hour if desired. You can read more about the public Github API limits [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/rate-limits-for-the-rest-api?apiVersion=2022-11-28#:~:text=The%20rate%20limit%20cannot%20increase,limits%20for%20the%20authenticated%20user.).
